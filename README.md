# Real_Time_Obj_Detection

In this project, I tried to detect objects in real time.

In order to achieve this goal, I used:
  - OpenCV to capture my webcam,
  - and [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to detect object.

How to improve this code:
  - by using GPU acceleration and get more fps (decrease of computation time),
  - and by testing other object detection algorithms ([YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet), a more complexe version of YOLOv5, a faster R-CNN algorithm with [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub?hl=fr), etc).
